# Text-Based-Python-Game
Text based game written in Python. I developed this code 10/2022 while working toward my Bachelor's Degree in computer science at Southern New Hampshire University. This game was written and turned in as my final project in IT-140 Introduction to Scripting
<br/>

The following code builds a text-based game written in Python. In this game, you are stuck inside of a museum with a group of vicious robbers. The robbers are after an extremely valuable gemstone that has belonged to your family for centuries. You must stop the robbers by leaving the office to collect items that you need to trigger the panic button that is located in the storage room (Where the robbers are!). <br/>
 You must get the following items before making your way to the robbers and pushing the panic button:
 <br/>
*A map of the museum that is located in the training room,
<br/>
*A sword (to protect yourself with)from the Samurai room,
<br/>
*A key that is hidden in the mummy exhibit room,
<br/>
*An energy bar from the break room(to gain enough energy to complete the mission),
<br/>
*A pen and a piece of paper from the lobby which you will use to write down important  information about the criminals,
<br/>
*and a password that will grant you access to the panic button.
<br/>
        The robbers are hiding out in the storage room putting final touches on their heist.
        Be sure not to run into them before collecting all 6 items
   After collecting all of the items you will make your way to the storage room, unlock the door, enter the password you collected on your way and finally push the panic button to alert police and stop the robbers. <br/>
      		**HOW TO PLAY:**

        
        You can navigate the museum using the following prompts:
        
        Type 'Go north' to travel north
      
       Type 'Go south' to travel south
       
        Type 'Go east' to travel east
        
        Type 'Go west' to travel west
        

       *If you see an item in a room you can retrieve that item by typing get 'item name'
       
       
     **You must collect all 6 items and make your way to the storage room to win the game**
